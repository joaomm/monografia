	and governance practices is a traditional research problem. However,
	the extent to which consolidated results on this relationship remain
	valid for open source (OS) projects is an open research problem.
	An emerging body of literature contrasts the view of open source
	as an alternative to proprietary software and explains that there
	exists a continuum between closed and open source projects. This
	paper hypothesizes that as projects approach the OS end of the continuum,
	governance becomes less formal. in turn a less formal governance
	is hypothesized to require a higher-quality code as a means to facilitate
	coordination among developers by making the structure of code explicit
	and facilitate quality by removing the pressure of deadlines from
	contributors. However, a less formal governance is also hypothesized
	to increase development effort due to a more cumbersome coordination
	overhead. the verification of research hypotheses is based on empirical
	data from a sample of 75 major OS projects. Empirical evidence supports
	our hypotheses and suggests that software quality, mainly measured
	as coupling and inheritance, does not increase development effort,
	but represents an important managerial variable to implement the
	more open governance approach that characterizes OS projects which,
	in turn, increases development effort.}},

	This paper discusses these anomalies, describes a simple extension

	conditions plus one). Although the new metric seems to deal adequately
	with the examples cited, the new measure lacks the appeal of a single

%
Individual user-programmers decide whether to invest their own effort to develop
a software enhancement that will become a public good if so developed.
%
The effect of changing the population size of user-programmers is considered;
finite and asymptotic results are given. Welfare results are presented.
%
It is shown that whether development will increase when applications have a
modular structure depends on whether the developer base exceeds a critical size.
%
Potential explanations of several stylized facts are given, including why
certain useful programs don't get written.}

Several studies have validated that various metrics are useful indicators of maintenance effort in the procedural paradigm. However, software metrics have rarely been studied in the object oriented paradigm. Very few metrics have been proposed to measure object oriented systems, and the proposed ones have not been validated. This research concentrates on several object oriented software metrics and the validation of these metrics with maintenance effort in two commercial systems},
